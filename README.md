## About me!

I am a man who started managing large networks online, I later ended up in the hosting world where I unfortunately first encountered the lesser side of hosting, later I grew to companies that still exist today and where I still work today.

## Project: GameUnit

As I said in my intro, I am currently very active in the hosting world, especially GameUnit. This is a hosting company that sells or rents VPSs and Gameservers. I currently have a permanent position there as Marketing Director and Teamleader.
