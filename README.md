## About me!

I am a man who started managing large networks online, I later ended up in the hosting world where I unfortunately first encountered the lesser side of hosting, later I grew to companies that still exist today and where I still work today.

## Project: FlexyNode

As I said in my intro, I am currently very active in the hosting world, especially FlexyNode. This is a hosting company that sells or rents VPSs, GameServers, and Dedicateds for low prices. I currently have a permanent position there as team leader and I manage the entire team.
